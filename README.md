# PushLua
Lua Framework for the Ableton Push 1


This framework allows the scripting of the Ableton Push 1 functionality via Lua.<br>
This should allow the creation of a standalone instrument or the use of Push as a standalone MIDI controller.<br>
The original idea of this framework is to use the Push connected to an Akai Force as an additional note entry.<br>
<br>
This is a very early, yet functional, work in progress and collaboration is welcome and encouraged.<br>
<br>
The software is developed in a modular way, so it can be used for other devices other than the Push 1.<br>

## Building

On Windows just extract and double click on setup.cmd to create the Visual Studio environment. Open and build.<br>
On Linux just use the Makefile inside the Source folder.
